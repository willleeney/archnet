# Archnet Plugin 

Creates possibile branches for LLM text generation in the Canvas. 

Select a card in the canvas and press <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to generate completions. Completions will be generated based on the aggregation of text upstream of the graph.  

You will need to set your secret key in the settings before this can be used - https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. 

This is a work-in-progress, suggestions welcome.
